            <p>I really like to write down my thoughts. I have notebooks, journals, and uncountable scraps of paper with everything from ideas, meeting minutes, recipes and project designs to half-written stories and blog posts.</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>I’ve tried several times to make the jump into an electronic solution, as the benefits are many and obvious, but every time I have found the solution to be too much of a sacrifice. It’s not that I’m married to the feel over paper and the scratch of graphite, but rather the new electronic medium forced me to sacrifice flexibility to comply with their system, while at the same time falling short of the powerful benefits that I imagined an electronic system would be able to provide.</p>
<p>The intent of this post is to plumb the theory behind notetaking. Of the successful and innovating solutions that have been presented, why were they successful, what did they sacrifice, and finally how might all of these innovations be combined into a complete and wonderful whole?</p>
<p>I’ll start with those things that you get almost for free (conceptually) in an electronic system. You don’t get any bonus points for coming up with these, because they’re just the logical extension of what people have been doing with pen and paper for ever.</p>
<ul>
<li>easy modification, undo, redo, backups, etc</li>
<li>no worry about hand writing</li>
<li>search</li>
<li>tags (lots of written systems include a manually updated index)</li>
</ul>
<p>I also don’t want to spend much time on “surface” features - things that could also be implemented under a different system without changing the core decision. I’m interested in the fundamental decisions that went into a system’s data representation, presentation, and organization.</p>
<p>One of the big possible advantages of electronic note taking is that movement between representations is theoretically cheap. Over the course of a traditional planning session, ideas might be first written on a white board, then transferred to sticky notes for easy rearrangement, then written down on a large paper for final presentation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it seems that with the movement to electronic note-taking, we haven’t actually gained much in this department. You might first keep your ideas on virtual sticky notes then coalesce them in a google doc for collaborative unstructured brainstorming, then move them over to trello as they become tasks with dealines. By hand. Seriously?</p>
<p>I find this rediculous. And I’m not asking for all these companies to implement interoperable import/export protocols. Don’t make me switch context!</p>
<p>It’s as if each company picked up on a single representation from the physical world and only concerned themselves with replicating that system in the digital world, albeit with some cheap and obvious improvements. What I’ve come to recognize is that I want different representations in different contexts, but ultimately <em>with the same data</em>.</p>
<p>I want you to give me digital sticky notes that transform themselves into trello cards, and then into a mind map, and then a workflowy list, and then back again.</p>
<p>I’ve narrowed down my criteria for a notetaking system into four catagories. Representation, Navigation &amp; Organization, Collaboration, and Presentation.</p>
<h3 id="Representation">Representation</h3>
<p>Can you handle the data?</p>
<p>First there’s content, which could be text, pictures, audio, drawings, diagrams or video. Ideally I would be able to create/edit, link and embed to any of these.</p>
<p>Then there’s meta-data - structured data about the content. The metadata depends on the type of note; a quote would have a source and a speaker, an appointment would have a time, duration, location, attendees, a reminder would have a time, a task would have a “completed” boolean, etc. Storing the metadata separate from the content allows the system to really give me control over my notes, and go far beyond the capabilities of a simple notebook.</p>
<h3 id="Organization">Organization</h3>
<p>If you’re able to represent the contents of my notes, now give me the tools to organize it. I want two main things here. First, custom hierarchy (think workflowy, mind maps). But more than that, I actually want a node to have multiple parents. I want to be able to organize an item in multiple contexts without sacrificing either.</p>
<h3 id="Navigation">Navigation</h3>
<p>Search: This is an easy one. Give me a “go to anywhere” power, with recency as a big factor in rank, along with height in the tree, and number of children.</p>
<p>Filter: In the context of one section of my notes, show me all of the items that match a certain criterion.</p>
<p>Favorite: This can actually be solved by the multiple parentage thing much better than anything else. Yes?</p>
<p>History: Show me where I was last, and before that. In a large system, recency is huge.</p>
<p>Context: Wherever I am, I need to know how I got there, and how to get back. In a large complex organization, context is key.</p>
<p>Keyboard Shortcuts: If you don’t have powerful keyboard shortcuts, I’ll always end up going back to VIM, because I can work so much faster with a powerful keyboard shortcut system.</p>
<h3 id="Prior_Work">Prior Work</h3>
<p>Evernote: Evernote might possibly be the most popular note manager out there at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>Data Representation &amp; Organization:</strong> Evernote’s notes are rich text, and can contain snippets of web pages, audio, images, drawings, handwriting. They nailed that one pretty well.<br>The organization of notes, however, is rather rudimentary, assuming that the level of organization you had in the old world of paper notebook was completely sufficient.</p>
<p>You have notebooks and notes within that notebook. And you can also make stacks of notebooks, so you have three levels of organization. Other than that, there are tags on notes, which replicate the old-school hand-managed indicies of the past. And that’s it.</p>
<p>Do I treat men differently than I treat women?<br>And interesting test for this would be if I were interacting, say, with a man, and then I found out that he was a woman. Either online, or a trasngender person. I wonder.</p>
<p>Workflowy makes the assumption that notebooks &amp; pages are all you really need as </p>
<p>Sticky Notes (whiteboard)<br>Evernote &amp;c<br>Mindmaps<br>Trello<br>Workflowy</p>

So many things.

Today I was sustained as a Stake Family History Co-Director, and set apart, and the setting apart blessing was pretty amazing. It was one of those things where I think "Wow, God is really in charge of things". In the setting apart blessing, he talked about the law of consecration, using all of my time and talents =) Which is one of the things I think about a lot. And he knows.

Men's chorus is so amazing! First, one of the members announced on Friday that he had decided to get baptized! Then, we went over a bit of "The Lord is my Light", and I discovered that I'm really bad at singing while crying :) What amazed me was that it only took a few measures and the spirit was there in force. Incredible.

Also I love the temple. It has taught me more about the atonement than anything else in my life. As a missionary, I often wished I had a more concrete understanding and testimony of the atonement. Now I understand so much more, but in many ways haven't developed the vocabulary to describe it. Some things must be felt.

Regarding failure: Read the Ensign home teaching message for this month!! It is so amazing. President Uchtdorf explains wonderfully the nature of goal setting and (I was surprised) the inevitability of failure. But, he says, once we understand that we will fail, it removes the surprise and discouragement of failure. And we can recognize that, though we fell short of our goal, we have indeed progressed.

One of the things that I felt about the message centered around discouragement. Discouragement always comes from the Adversary, from the father of lies. Our Father in Heaven would never say to us "you should be discouraged right now", just as he would never say "you should be ashamed". Time and again, the prophets bring the message **"Take courage"**, for the Lord your God is with you.

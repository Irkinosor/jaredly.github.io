I [recently switched](??) from [ghost](http://ghost.org) to [hexo](http://hexo.io), and the biggest thing missing for me was the editor UI. So I made one. Currently, it's mostly a clone of the Ghost interface, but I have some ideas for making it even more awesome.

Key features:
- side-by-side markdown editing
- auto-save posts

Missing features (which you can do just fine w/ the raw files):
- publish/unpublish
- categories
- tags

Future awesome:
- paste-to-insert a picture
- drag & drop to insert a picture or file
- autocomplete for linking to other posts

I [recently switched](/switching-from-ghost-to-hexo/) from [ghost](http://ghost.org) to [hexo](http://hexo.io), and the biggest thing missing for me was the editor interface. So I made one. Currently, it's mostly a clone of the Ghost interface, but I have some ideas for making it even more awesome.

#### Posts overview

#### Editor view

**Features:**
- side-by-side markdown editing
- auto-save posts
- paste to insert an image
- publish/unpublish

**Missing features (which you can still do just fine w/ the raw files):**
- edit categories & tags
- edit publish date/time
- edit slug

**Future awesome:**
- drag & drop to insert a picture or file
- autocomplete for linking to other posts
- git commit from the UI?
